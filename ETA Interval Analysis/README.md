## Objective
Create an automatic intelligent analysis based on the recent information regarding ETA errors. By determining a target ETA accuracy, intervals were calculated via proposing lower and upper interval solutions to satisfy the desired accuracy. The ones with the lowest amplitude whilst acomplishing the target accuracy are considered the best.
